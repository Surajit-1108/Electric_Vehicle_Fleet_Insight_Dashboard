Power BI Dashboard

Project objective: The aim of this project is to create an extensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing fleet insights of electric vehicles, encompassing both the adaption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and CAFV eligibility.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population/data

Softwares Used: MS Excel & Power BI

Goals:
- Comprehensively analyze the electric vehicle landscape, including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), to evaluate the market's size and growth from 2010 to the beginning of 2024.
- Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
- Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset and calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
- Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset and calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of fully electric models.
- Illustrate the distribution of electric vehicles over the years, starting from 2010, providing insights into the growth pattern and adoption trends.
- Showcase the geographical distribution of electric vehicles across different states, aloowing for the identification of regions with higher adoption rate.
- Highlight the top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers based on the total number of vehicles, providing insights into the market dominance of specific brands.
- Illustrate the proportion of electric vehicles that are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, aiding in understanding the impact of incentives on vehicle adoption.
- Highlight the top 10 electric vehicle models based on the total number of vehicles, offering insights into customer preferences and popular models in the market.


Steps:
1. Data Integration: Connected to MS Excel to gather the electric vehicle data.
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Prepared the data by ensuring accuracy and consistency, making it suitable for analysis.
3. Data Analysis: Throughly analyze the data and keeping the usefull columns to create a clear and understandable insight.
4. Dashboard Design: Created interactive visualizations within Power BI to present key metrics like total vehicle size, average electric range, BEV size and their percentage relative to the total number of electric vehicles, PHEV size and their percentage of relative to the total number of electric vehicles.
5. Dashboard Analysis: Extracted insights from the dashboard, focusing on trends and areas requiring further investigation.
   
Insights:
1. Total electric vehicle size according to the dataset is about 150.42k.
2. Average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset 67.83 (as it is not clearly mentioned in the data about the unit 'miles' or 'km', we simply took the average of 'Electric range').
3. The total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset is 117k and the the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles is 78%.
4. The total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset is 34k and the the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles is 22%.
5. The adoption of electric vehicles is increasing year on year. Please note that the data is only available until the half of January 2024, which may give the impression of a decline. However, this trend does not reflect the entire year's data.
6. The top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers, ranked by the total number of vehicles in the market, are Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, BMW, KIA, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo, and Jeep.
7. It was found that 41.81% of electric vehicles qualify for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, while 11.86% are ineligible due to low battery range. Research is underway to determine the eligibility of 46.33% of electric vehicles for CAFV incentives. It was observed that BEV vehicles comprise the majority of vehicles eligible for CAFV incentives.
